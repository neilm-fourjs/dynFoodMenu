# A Dynamic Food Menu Mobile App

The goal was to generate the screen and the dialog dynamically based on the data provided.

There are two versions of the program:
* dynFoodMenu - main code stripped out into library functions and a WC menu added
* dynFoodMenu2 - a single .4gl example of just the form generation and input
